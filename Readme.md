# Tobin Neighborhood Map
## Description
A front-end app that displays some of my go-to places for food and drink in Pasadena.  
It uses the Google Maps API, Foursquare API, and the Knockout.js framework to do the following:
* Display a map of Pasadena with some locations marked
* Display the names of the locations in a list
* Allow the user to filter locations based on the name and some associated keywords
* Display a little info about the location when it is clicked on, either in the list or on the map

## Installation
Download this repository to install it. The necessary libraries are included

## How to run the App

Open index.html. The onscreen map can scroll and zoom like a regular Google Map.  
Dragging the mouse over the locations on the list or the markers on the map will bounce the marker and display the location's name.  
Clicking on the location, on the list or on the map, will animate the marker and display some more information about the current status of the establishment.
